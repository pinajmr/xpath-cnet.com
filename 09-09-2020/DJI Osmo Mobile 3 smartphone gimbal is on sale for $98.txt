DJI Osmo Mobile 3 smartphone gimbal is on sale for $98

That's not the lowest price ever, but it's close.

When new products arrive, older ones get discounted. Case in point: 
 a couple of weeks back, and now the previous-gen model is on sale. For a limited time, and while supplies last, Amazon has the 
. That's not the lowest price on record, but it's still a $20 savings. 
Anyone who has video aspirations (TikTok, moviemaking or other) would welcome a tool like this. The Osmo Mobile 3 is a folding, travel-friendly smartphone stabilizer designed to help you capture rock-steady footage. (See the similar 
 in the video below if you're not clear on the concept.)  You'll want to read Josh Goldman's 
 to learn more: He loved all aspects of the design, from the compact (when folded) frame to the weight to the 15-hour battery life. 
As you'll see there, the gimbal originally sold for $119 on its own. As for the newer DJI OM4 (the "Osmo Mobile" branding is gone), which relies on a magnetic mount rather than a clamp, it's $149. 
The DJI Osmo Mobile 3 has glowing reviews pretty much everywhere. Just one caveat: Given that I've seen it priced a bit less before, and that there's now officially a newer version available, 
 that the holidays are coming, it's a good bet even better deals are imminent. So it might behoove you to wait.
