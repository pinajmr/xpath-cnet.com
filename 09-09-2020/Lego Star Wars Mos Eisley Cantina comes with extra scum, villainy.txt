Lego Star Wars Mos Eisley Cantina comes with extra scum, villainy

Recreate the moment when Han Solo and Luke Skywalker first met, and decide for yourself if Han shot first.

You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy -- but that's what makes the Mos Eisley Cantina 
 
 set so much fun.
Lego's newest set recreates the infamous moment when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi first meet Han Solo and Chewbacca in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. It's a huge turning point in the galaxy-spanning saga, so the set is suitably weighty.
The 3,187-piece set opens up to over half a metre square, including cantina and outbuildings plus extras like two landspeeders and a lumbering dewback. It comes with 21 minifigs, including Luke, Han, C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewie and some stormtroopers.
The denizens of the dive bar also include Greedo, so you can recreate the famous shootout when 
. You also get such beloved characters as Ponda Baba, Dr. Evazan, droid-racist barman, Garindan the snitch, devil guy, and the legendary cantina band Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes.
The Mos Eisley Cantina Lego set goes on sale for Lego VIP members Sept. 16 and then globally from Oct. 1. The sizeable set won't be cheap, but just think of it as a perfect lockdown project.
